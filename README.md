# cpp-consistent-hashing-algorithms

## Overview

This project collects C++ implementations of the most prominent consistent hashing algorithms for non-peer-to-peer contexts.

The implemented algorithms are:

- [1997] Ring by [D. Karger et al.](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf)
- [1998] Rendezvous by [Thaler and Ravishankar](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/663936)
- [2014] Jump by [Lamping and Veach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2294.pdf)
- [2015] Multi-probe by [Appleton and Oâ€™Reilly](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00062.pdf)
- [2016] Maglev by [D. E. Eisenbud](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44824.pdf)
- [2020] Anchor by [Gal Mendelson et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09674.pdf)
- [2021] Dx by [Chaos Dong and Fang Wang](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07930.pdf)
- [2023] Power by [Eric Leu](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12448.pdf)
- [2023] Memento by [M. Coluzzi et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09783.pdf)

Each implementation is divided into two classes:

- Each `<Algorithm>Engine` class (e.g., AnchorEngine) contains an accurate implementation of the algorithm as described in the related paper. These classes do not make any consistency check to keep the performance as close as possible to what was claimed in the related papers.
- Each `<Algoritm>Hash` class (e.g., AnchorHash) is a wrapper of the related <Algorithm>Engine class allowing every implementation to match the same interface. These classes also perform all the consistency checks needed to grant a safe execution.

### Benchmarks

The project includes a benchmarking tool designed explicitly for consistent hashing algorithms.
The tool allows benchmarking the following metrics in a fair and agnostic way:

- **Memory usage**: the amount of memory the algorithm uses to store its internal structure.
- **Init time**: the time the algorithm requires to initialize its internal structure.
- **Resize time**: the time the algorithm requires to reorganize its internal structure after adding or removing nodes.
- **Lookup time**: the time the algorithm needs to find the node a given key belongs to.
- **Balance**: the ability of the algorithm to spread the keys evenly across the cluster nodes.
- **Resize balance**: the ability of the algorithm to keep its balance after adding or removing nodes.
- Monotonicity: the ability of the algorithm to move the minimum amount of resources when the cluster scales.

You can build the tool using `Apache Maven`. It will generate a `jar` file called `consistent-hashing-algorithms-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. You can then run the jar file providing a configuration file to customize your execution.

The format of the configuration file is described in detail in the [`src/main/resources/configs/template.yaml`](src/main/resources/configs/template.yaml) file.
The tool will use the [`src/main/resources/configs/default.yaml`](src/main/resources/configs/default.yaml) file that represents the default configuration if no configuration file is provided.
